## 🔧 Platform Configuration

To support copying images to the system clipboard on **Android**. A platform configuration setup is required.
If not set up, a warning will appear in the log during debug mode only
if `copyImageToClipboard` was called without configuring the Android project.
An exception with less details will be thrown in production mode.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> This configuration is required on **Android** platform for using `copyImageToClipboard`.
> Other features on Android will work without it if this method isn't used.
> For more information, refer to the [Android FileProvider documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/content/FileProvider).

**1. Update `AndroidManifest.xml`**

Open `your_project/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        ...
        <provider
            android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider"
            android:authorities="${applicationId}.fileprovider"
            android:exported="false"
            android:grantUriPermissions="true" >
            <meta-data
                android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
                android:resource="@xml/file_paths" />
        </provider>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

**2. Create `file_paths.xml`**

Create the file `your_project/android/app/src/main/res/xml/file_paths.xml` with the following content:

```xml
<paths>
    <cache-path name="cache" path="." />
</paths>
```

## 🚧 Experimental

This package is in early development despite the version since it previously had the same version as [flutter_quill](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill), now they have been separated. The [Flutter Quill](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/tree/master/.github/workflows) publishing workflow releases one stable version for all packages even if no changes were introduced.

Fixing the version requires discounting the support for [quill_native_bridge](https://pub.dev/packages/quill_native_bridge) and publishing a new package.
